# QloApps-Reusable-CSRF-Token-in-Logout-Functionality

**Product:** [QloApps â€“ Hotel Booking & Reservation System]  
**Tested Version:** [version / demo instance]  
**CWE:** CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
## Description
QloApps uses a token parameter (`token=...`) in the logout function to protect against CSRF attacks. However, this implementation is flawed:

1. The **logout URL exposes the CSRF token** in the query string.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     https://demo.qloapps.com/103-208-230-52/?mylogout=1&token=a2edbe57e755bafd90828744d4a8679d
     ```
   - Since the token is in the URL, it can be leaked via browser history, server logs, referrer headers, and third-party analytics scripts.  

2. The token is **reusable across multiple requests** and does not expire after one use.  

Together, these weaknesses allow attackers to repeatedly force a user logout and potentially bypass CSRF protections if similar token logic is used in other sensitive operations.
